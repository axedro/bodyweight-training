## Architecture Overview

This is a **full-stack adaptive bodyweight training application** built as a monorepo with web and mobile applications sharing core business logic.

### Technology Stack
- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Web Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
- **Mobile Frontend**: React Native (Expo) + TypeScript + React Native Paper
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Shared Logic**: TypeScript package (`@bodyweight/shared`)

### Core Features
- **Adaptive Training Algorithm**: Calculates user's Current Capacity Index (ICA) and generates personalized workouts
- **Progressive Exercise System**: 7-level progression for each movement pattern (push, pull, squat, hinge, core, locomotion)
- **Recovery-Aware Programming**: Considers sleep, fatigue, and training history
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Real-time synchronization between web and mobile

## Database Architecture

### Key Tables
- `user_profiles`: Extended user data beyond Supabase auth
- `exercises`: Exercise catalog with progression levels
- `training_sessions`: Completed workout sessions
- `session_exercises`: Individual exercises within sessions
- `wellness_logs`: Daily recovery metrics (sleep, fatigue)
- `algorithm_state`: Cached algorithm calculations per user

### Important Database Operations
- All tables use Row Level Security (RLS) for user data isolation
- Edge Functions handle complex calculations (ICA, routine generation)
- Database migrations are versioned and applied automatically

## Adaptive Training Algorithm

The core algorithm is implemented in `packages/shared/src/` and calculates:

### ICA Formula
```typescript
ICA = (fitness_level √ó adherence_rate √ó recovery_factor √ó progression_velocity) / detraining_factor
```

### Key Algorithm Components
- **Recovery Factor**: Based on sleep quality, hours, and fatigue level
- **Adherence Rate**: Percentage of completed workouts in last 4 weeks  
- **Progression Velocity**: Rate of recent improvements
- **Detraining Factor**: Penalty for inactivity periods

### Exercise Progression Logic
- 7 levels per exercise pattern (wall push-ups ‚Üí one-arm push-ups)
- Advance after 3 successful sessions at target reps
- Regress after 2 failed sessions or low ICA
- Safety limits prevent excessive volume increases

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Shared Types**: All TypeScript interfaces in `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
- **Algorithm Logic**: Core training algorithm in shared package
- **UI Components**: 
  - Web: ShadCN components in `apps/web/app/components/ui/`
  - Mobile: React Native Paper components
- **API Routes**: Supabase Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`

### Environment Setup
1. Supabase requires `.env.local` (web) and `.env` (mobile) with connection strings
2. Shared package must be built before running applications: `cd packages/shared && npm run build`
3. Use local Supabase for development: `npm run supabase:start`

### Testing Strategy
- Algorithm logic should be unit tested in shared package
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component testing for critical UI flows
- Test database migrations with `npm run db:reset`

### Key Integration Points
- **API Communication**: Apps communicate with Supabase Edge Functions
- **State Management**: React Context for user state and algorithm data
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with automatic user profile creation
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase realtime subscriptions for cross-device sync

## Authentication System

The authentication system has been completely rewritten and uses a state-based approach for reliable user flows:

### Authentication Flow States
```typescript
type AppState = 'loading' | 'auth' | 'onboarding' | 'dashboard'
```

### Key Authentication Components

#### Main App (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`)
- **State Management**: Centralized authentication state with proper session handling
- **Session Persistence**: Handles Supabase session cookies properly
- **Navigation Logic**: Automatic routing based on user state and profile completion
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logs with emoji prefixes for debugging

#### Auth Component (`apps/web/app/components/auth.tsx`)
- **Callback Architecture**: Uses `onAuthSuccess` callback for proper state management
- **Auto-Login**: Automatically logs in user after successful registration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Dual Forms**: Login and signup in tabs with shared form validation

#### Onboarding Component (`apps/web/app/components/onboarding.tsx`)
- **Multi-Step Flow**: 3-step onboarding process with progress tracking
  - Step 1: Basic Information (age, weight, height)
  - Step 2: Fitness Experience (level, years, available days)
  - Step 3: Training Preferences (duration, intensity)
- **Step Validation**: Each step validates required fields before allowing progression
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar and step counter
- **Enhanced UX**: Emojis, descriptive labels, and motivational messaging

#### Dashboard Component (`apps/web/app/components/dashboard.tsx`)
- **Props-Based Architecture**: Receives user data via props instead of managing auth internally
- **Logout Callback**: Uses callback system for proper logout handling
- **ICA Integration**: Displays user's adaptive training metrics and recommendations

### Database Integration
- **Auto Profile Creation**: Database trigger automatically creates user_profiles record
- **Profile Updates**: Onboarding updates existing profile instead of creating new ones
- **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling for database timeout and connection issues

### Development Notes
- **Session Management**: Sessions are stored in HTTP-only cookies, not localStorage
- **Environment Variables**: Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Debugging**: Extensive logging with emoji prefixes for easy troubleshooting:
  - üöÄ Initialization
  - üîê Authentication 
  - üìù Registration/Updates
  - üë§ Profile operations
  - ‚ùå Errors
  - ‚úÖ Success operations

## API Versioning Strategy

### Version Format
We use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require client updates
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible  
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and small improvements

### Breaking Changes Policy
- Breaking changes are announced at least 30 days in advance
- Previous major version is supported for 90 days after new release
- Migration guides are provided for all breaking changes

### Feature Deprecation
- Features marked as deprecated continue to work for at least one major version
- Deprecation warnings are included in API responses
- Alternative approaches are documented in the changelog

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v2.7 to v2.8
**New Features (Backward Compatible):**
- Optional `biometricData` parameter in `/generate-routine`
- New `/get-latest-biometrics` endpoint
- Enhanced ICA calculation with historical data

**No breaking changes** - all existing integrations continue to work.

### Migrating from v2.6 to v2.7
**New Features (Backward Compatible):**
- New `/analyze-muscle-groups` endpoint
- Enhanced `/save-session-feedback` with exercise performance tracking
- Additional response fields in session feedback

**Recommended Updates:**
```javascript
// Before v2.7
await saveSessionFeedback(sessionId, basicFeedback);

// v2.7+ with enhanced tracking
await saveSessionFeedback(sessionId, basicFeedback, exercisePerformance);
```

### Migrating from v2.5 to v2.6
**Breaking Changes:**
- Removed Next.js API routes - update base URLs to point directly to Edge Functions
- Algorithm responses now include real exercise data instead of mock exercises

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update base URL from `/api/` to `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/`
2. Update authentication headers to include Supabase JWT tokens
3. Test exercise data parsing with real exercise objects

**Before v2.6:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/generate-routine', { ... });
```

**After v2.6:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/generate-routine`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwt_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```
